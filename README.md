# Huddersfield Picture House

* Huddersfield Picture House is a fictional independent cinema in the town of the same name in the United Kingdom. The app provides a booking system so that site users and admin/staff can manage cinema ticket bookings, which are primarily comprised of the film, the show time and the seats chosen. Both site users and cinema staff can make bookings on the front end, whilst only admin/staff can edit and delete bookings in the back end via the Django admin panel.

## Project Planning

* This project was developed through Github's Kanban board. A link to the board can be found in the site's repository. Cards were created to provide achievable goals for the site during development. User stories were the driving factor behind the cards and helped orient my coding efforts.

## Technologies

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - this hosted the project's repository.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and [CodeAnywhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com/) - these were the IDEs used for building the application. Development switched from Gitpod to CodeAnywhere through development.
* [Elephantsql](https://www.elephantsql.com/) - this database hosted the PostgreSQL for the project.
* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html) - primary language of the application.
* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) - Structure/skeleton of the page
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - extra styling of the webpage
* [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) - custom JavaScript was used in the project.
* [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - I queried some errors using questions posted here.
* [Bootstrap 5](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_get_started.php) - the primary framework used in implementing many site elements.
